# API built with Node and Express

### Have built APIs for self service in Rails Apps,
### And Rails API for external service

Diving into a some amazingness with JS backend!
  * currently one resource
    * full CRUD for 'secrets'
  * access through /api/secrets/*

Using the learned knowledge in this to attach to a JS app that currently uses localStorage as its DB thing... which as a Back-End student made me feel weird.
